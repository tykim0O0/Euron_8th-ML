                                                                                                                               The keyboard is now as good as the HP and Samsung netbooks .\\n2                                                                                                                                       The keyboards are 92% the size of those found on a standard computer and the machines run a little hot .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                           The keyboard is large enough to accommodate touch typing with ease .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                    At home I now have my Asus connected to my desktop's keyboard and monitor .\\n5                                                                                                                                      However, since I do a lot of word processing, the keyboard and the touchpad buttons were a real concern .\\n6                                                                                                                             The keyboard has a responsive feel and the larger keys   along with the oversize right shift key are a real plus .\\n7                                                       The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n8                                                                                                                                                 Battery life continues to hold up and the keyboard is a true godsend with its full size keys .\\n9                                                                      , Tiny and light the slightly smaller than standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .\\n10                                                                                                                                                      The keyboard is quite nice and I have very large hands and I make a lot fewer mistakes .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                    The fit and finish are very good, no gaps and I like the keyboard layout .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard is easy to use .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard has a decent feel but seems more cramped than the 1005ha .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                         Definitely the best looking netbook, and possibly the best keyboard .\\n15                                                           The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                   The keyboard, though slightly smaller than standard, is a pleasure to use .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is terrific, solid feel and full size .\\n18                                                                                                                                          The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n19                                                                                                                                               The keyboard is REALLY easy to get used to, possibly the best netbook keyboard I've ever used .\\n20                                                                                                                                                             It was easy to set up, and I really liked the comfort of the mouse and keyboard .\\n21                                              The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                         The keyboard and mouse are my biggest concern for the tiny computer .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                        The keyboard is functional, but takes a little bit of getting use to .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      Build quality is great, love the touchpad and keyboard .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                 Keyboard is not as sturdy as I would like has some minor flex\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                  keyboard is actually a pleasure to use inspite of small size\\n27                                                                                                                                                                              Well, I'm a touch typist and very particular about my keyboard .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     The only comparable keyboards I found were those on much larger laptops .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                          My keyboard also seems a bit noisy .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                         However, two weeks in, the keyboard would sporadically stop working .\\n31                                                                                                                       The build quality is very good, and the keyboard, though small, is surprisingly comfortable and has good key response .\\n32                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is generous for a netbook, but I still have some trouble typing on it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                 They keyboard takes some getting used to, but even still, I could not write a novel on this .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                       Keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .\\n36                                   I have briefly tried typing on a number of netbooks since last fall, and this is the only one that had a decent keyboard just big enough to accommodate my hands and not result in multiple typing errors .\\n37                                                                                                                                         I have large hands and with a little time on the keyboard I'm breezing through word processing jobs .\\n38                                                                                                                                        I found the ASUS keyboard comfortable to type quickly  it is touch, typeable after brief acclimation .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                             The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .\\n41                                                                                                       With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .\\n42                                                                                                                                      I think the most important thing on these small netbooks is the keyboard, and this one feels very good .\\n43                                                                                                      I notice the tighter keyboard spacing, but it seems easy to type on, yielding no more typing errors than my bad typing normally yields .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  keyboard feels well laid out\\n45                                                                                                      The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .\\n46                                                                                                   Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n47                                                                                                                           While I still like the keyboard style of the Toshiba better, the EEE PC has some features that are pretty awesome !\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard doesn't have separation between the keys   .\\n49                                                                                                                                                            I also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .\\n50                                                                                                                    I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place .\\n51                                                                                                                                                           It did not seem to affect the use of the keyboard but it was a slight distraction .\\n52

                                                                                                                               The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                 Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .\\n55

               It is smaller than a standard keyboard, but after a day or two I got used to it and now I can type pretty fast with few mistakes .\\n57                                                                                                                       I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n58                                                                                                                                 I goosed up the memory to 2G and stuffed a 8G SD memory board in the slot on the right side of the keyboard .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                    The

plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n61

.\\n63

to unplug and replug power, monitor, LAN, wireless mouse keyboard, hard drive back, up and PDA cable, but not the end of the world .\\n66                                                                           4 And finally the keyboard doesn't stay fastened down at the top it would seem like an easy fix, I've noted it for repair twice and I still have the same problem .\\n67

                                     My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n75                                                                                                                                       This was actually the one of the things I feared most, but turns out the keyboard is set up real nice .\\n76

regular typing and keys have a nice tactile feel .\\n78

                         The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .\\n80                                                                                                              I like the feel of the keyboard, and the touchpad software control makes it easy to use without getting in my way while I type .\\n81

small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n84

all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n87

                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16

valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

                                      I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed

                                So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

to press pretty hard on the screen if I want to 'drag' the map .\\n33                                                                                                                         The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n34

I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36                                                                                                                                                             From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?\\n37    I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .\\n38

case that zippered the screen in, as I didn't want the possibility of it sliding out .\\n43                                                                                                                                             Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .\\n44

protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .\\n46

only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n50

a mute button on the screen available at all times .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79

.\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82

                                                                                                                                  I look at the direction line at the top bar of the screen to make sure I understand what the verbal instructions were .\\n84                                                                                                                                                3

screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .\\n91                                                                                                                                                After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                               When attached to the PC, the screen just indicates the connection .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                   The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                  We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n95

.\\n96                                                                                                                                                                           Looking at comparable

                     Then we picked up the free lobby coffee and the WSJ and the USA Today newspapers, thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n66

you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70

when one could meet other guests .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?\\n72

                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n74

jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .\\n77

life continues to hold up and the keyboard is a true godsend with its full size keys .\\n9                                                                      , Tiny and light the slightly smaller than standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .\\n10

                                                                                                                                             The fit and finish are very good, no gaps and I like the keyboard layout .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard is easy to use .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard has a decent feel but seems more cramped than the 1005ha .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                         Definitely the best looking netbook, and possibly the best keyboard .\\n15                                                           The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                   The keyboard, though slightly smaller than standard, is a pleasure to use .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is terrific, solid feel and full size .\\n18                                                                                                                                          The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n19                                                                                                                                               The keyboard is REALLY easy to get used to, possibly the best netbook keyboard I've ever used .\\n20                                                                                                                                                             It was easy to set up, and I really liked the comfort of the mouse and keyboard .\\n21                                              The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                         The keyboard and mouse are my biggest concern for the tiny computer .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                        The keyboard is functional, but takes a little bit of getting use to .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      Build quality is great, love the touchpad and keyboard .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                 Keyboard is not as sturdy as I would like has some minor flex\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                  keyboard is actually a pleasure to use inspite of small size\\n27                                                                                                                                                                              Well, I'm a touch typist and very particular about my keyboard .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     The only comparable keyboards I found were those on much larger laptops .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                          My keyboard also seems a bit noisy .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                         However, two weeks in, the keyboard would sporadically stop working .\\n31                                                                                                                       The build quality is very good, and the keyboard, though small, is surprisingly comfortable and has good key response .\\n32                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is generous for a netbook, but I still have some trouble typing on it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                 They keyboard takes some getting used to, but even still, I could not write a novel on this .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                       Keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .\\n36                                   I have briefly tried typing on a number of netbooks since last fall, and this is the only one that had a decent keyboard just big enough to accommodate my hands and not result in multiple typing errors .\\n37                                                                                                                                         I have large hands and with a little time on the keyboard I'm breezing through word processing jobs .\\n38                                                                                                                                        I found the ASUS keyboard comfortable to type quickly  it is touch, typeable after brief acclimation .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                             The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .\\n41                                                                                                       With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .\\n42                                                                                                                                      I think the most important thing on these small netbooks is the keyboard, and this one feels very good .\\n43                                                                                                      I notice the tighter keyboard spacing, but it seems easy to type on, yielding no more typing errors than my bad typing normally yields .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  keyboard feels well laid out\\n45                                                                                                      The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .\\n46                                                                                                   Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n47                                                                                                                           While I still like the keyboard style of the Toshiba better, the EEE PC has some features that are pretty awesome !\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard doesn't have separation between the keys   .\\n49                                                                                                                                                            I also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .\\n50                                                                                                                    I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place .\\n51                                                                                                                                                           It did not seem to affect the use of the keyboard but it was a slight distraction .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n53                                                                                                                                                       The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                 Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .\\n55

               It is smaller than a standard keyboard, but after a day or two I got used to it and now I can type pretty fast with few mistakes .\\n57

                                                                                                                        I goosed up the memory to 2G and stuffed a 8G SD memory board in the slot on the right side of the keyboard .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                    The

plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n61

                                     My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n75

stop responding .\\n105                                                                                                                         The keyboard feel is good but the touchpad is hard and being small I get confused with the side scroll area easily .\\n106

                                For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n108

               I also have the Eeepc 900, but I can't stand typing on that keyboard ,  I've typed on this one for 10 hour work training sessions without issue .\\n113

         The keyboard is awesome since it looks like regular one with a large backspace, and two shifts .\\n121

                                                           I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n124                                                   A lot of netbooks on the market have mangled the keyboard in one way or another such that if you are a touch typist, you find yourself hitting the wrong key often, which is frustrating .\",\n          \"

a bit easier .\\n1

                                          The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .\\n3                                                                Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9

.\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12

turn .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                        To make things worse,

                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16

valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

                                      I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .\\n27                                                                                                                                               So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

                             There were a few times I drove under overpasses on the interstate and no intersection was shown on the screen .\\n31

to press pretty hard on the screen if I want to 'drag' the map .\\n33                                                                                                                         The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n34

I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36                                                                                                                                                             From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?\\n37    I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .\\n38

that covers it screen .\\n42                                                                                                                                                     I chose a hard type of case that zippered the screen in, as I didn't want the possibility of it sliding out .\\n43                                                                                                                                             Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .\\n44

the screen !\\n45                                                                                                 These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .\\n46

direct sunlight, the screen is difficult to see in my convertible .\\n49                                                                                                                             Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n50

                                                                                                                                                               One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55

                                                   I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a

                                                                                                                                                     The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is

    If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is

the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65

        Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70

coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74

be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78

                                   After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92

           The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                  We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n95

                                 With either unit, the text on the screen usually tells you what you need to know .\\n101                                                                                                                                          I've only used the wide screen versions, so I can't compare, but I personally wouldn't want to go to a smaller screen .\\n102

They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .\\n5                                                                                                                                               If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6

I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

ever offered .\\n8                                                                                                                                 Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n23

                       It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n25

Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

those things are there if I need them .\\n29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

     Did I mention that Win7 offers nothing in terms of any new worthwhile features ?\\n31

headaches !\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                               I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .\\n33

Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46

the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .\\n47

7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .\\n50                                                                                                                      Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52

have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually

                         The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .\\n58

                     The screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .\\n59

                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n87

easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n91

too cramped .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen size works just fine for me .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

                          Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .\\n124

        The 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .\\n125

 Screen appearance is enhanced by Asus software, and I do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .\\n127

                                             The 10 inch screen started getting to me on the Asus 1005 .\\n128

  I love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .\\n129

different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .\\n130

and sufficently bright for occassional use .\\n131

and the unit runs great .\\n132

resolution .\\n133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n134

actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n135

                               The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n137

                                  The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .\\n138

should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n140

keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n142                                                                                                                                             It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n151

I can annotate while listening to the lecture .\\n152

done  the screen is glossy   .\\n153

extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n160

              This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

probably the biggest drawback .\\n164                                                                                                                                                                                                             Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170

it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                 As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n172

fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

                                  The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n57

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n60

the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

                                            Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

                           There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19                                                                                                                                              Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

in local establishments .\\n25

                                                                                                                                                                    Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

service .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                              There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

                                                   The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                            More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                             Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n71

fraction of the cost .\\n72

fast food if you like .\\n86                                                                                                                                                              Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n87

overall standards .\\n88

the location .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Location is great, 5 mins walk to the Natural History Museum, 15 to Kensington High St and 2 mins to the tube and in a high room you can see for miles   .\\n90

three weeks ago, acceleration is a major problem, just not like the older models of camry, was in a accident, hit on the front right side, right fender, car was considered total loss, not fixable, I would not purchase another camry disappointed is this 2007 camry, gas mileage is not as good as prior years, i had to purchase another vehicle, it was not a camry, made in ky, it was a solid 2007 toyota RAV4 made in japan .\\n73

                                                                                                        If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64

getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .\\n87

is reliable .\\n90                                                                                                                       So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable

                the significant transmission hesitations are unacceptable and possibly unsafe, and the 4 cyl engine provides inadequate power when challenged .\\n51

to a lot of great miles with this car .\\n101

commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                                                                                    The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                       Front seats are not comfortable on long trip .\\n40                                                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

                                                             The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior .\\n48                                                                                                                                                          Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49

                                                                                                                               Trunk is big and rear seat very comfortable for 2 and will seat 3 .\\n51

great for my 6'1  250 lbs .\\n52                                                                                                                I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54

Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90

has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106

may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                                        The styling does not say  Camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design .\\n42

                It serves the purpose in which I bought it, and I really do like the roomy interior and the new styling, but there really is no fun factor to it .\\n44
